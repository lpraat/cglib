# cglib
Under the src folder you can find an header only library written for the Computer graphics course @ Politecnico di Milano.

You can find:
- Some commonly used tensor structures (mat3, mat4, vec4, quaternion,...)
- Quaternion-based cameras
- Routines to deal with 3D transformations
- BRDF lighting models
- Routines for scene graphs

# Usage example
Under the project folder you can find an example project where the library is used to create a simulated drone flying on a custom terrain, which you can build via cmake (see CMakeLists.txt).
